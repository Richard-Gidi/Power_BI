# Life Expectancy Analysis Project

## Overview

This project analyzes factors affecting life expectancy by incorporating previously overlooked variables such as immunization rates and the Human Development Index (HDI). The analysis is based on a mixed effects model and multiple linear regression, utilizing data from 2000 to 2015 for 193 countries. The focus will be on significant health-related factors, including immunization (Hepatitis B, Polio, Diphtheria), mortality rates, economic conditions, and social factors.

## Motivation

Despite numerous studies on life expectancy influenced by demographic variables and income composition, the impact of immunization and HDI has been largely unexamined. Previous research primarily relied on single-year datasets. This project seeks to fill those gaps and provide a comprehensive analysis that can help countries identify key factors influencing life expectancy.

## Data Sources

The project relies on data accuracy, drawing from the following sources:

- **Global Health Observatory (GHO)**: Health status and related data for all countries, managed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
- **United Nations**: Economic data corresponding to health factors.

The dataset includes life expectancy and health factors for 193 countries, compiled into a single merged dataset. 

## Key Insights

### Global Overview of Life Expectancy

- **Average Life Expectancy**: **69.22 years**
- **Status Distribution**: Developed countries have an average life expectancy of **67.11 years**, while developing countries average **79.20 years**.
- **Countries Below Global Average**: Notable countries include Malawi, Angola, Central African Republic, and Sierra Leone.

### Immunization and Mortality

- **Average Mortality by Continent**: Significant variations exist, with Africa showing the highest average mortality rates.
- **Diseases Covered**: Data includes statistics on Hepatitis B, HIV/AIDS, Measles, Polio, and Diphtheria.

### Socio-Economic Factors

- **Percentage Expenditure by Status**: Developed countries spend significantly more on healthcare, correlating with higher life expectancy.
- **GDP Correlation**: Average GDP varies across continents, affecting life expectancy.
- **Correlation Between Schooling and Life Expectancy**: Education plays a crucial role in determining life expectancy, as it is closely linked to health awareness, access to healthcare, and socio-economic status. The analysis reveals a positive correlation between average years of schooling and life expectancy across different countries.

**Key Findings**:
  - Countries with higher levels of education tend to have longer life expectancies. This is attributed to better health literacy, leading to healthier lifestyle choices and increased utilization of healthcare services.
  - The data indicates that as the average years of schooling increase, life expectancy also rises. This trend is particularly evident in developed nations where educational infrastructure is well-established.
  - Conversely, developing countries often face challenges in educational attainment, which correlates with lower life expectancy rates.

## Objectives

- Analyze the impact of immunization and other health-related factors on life expectancy.
- Identify key predictive variables that contribute to lower life expectancy.
- Provide actionable insights for policymakers to improve life expectancy in their countries.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis of life expectancy in relation to various factors, the following recommendations are proposed to improve health outcomes globally:

1. **Enhance Immunization Programs**:
   - Strengthen immunization campaigns for critical vaccines (Hepatitis B, Polio, Diphtheria) to reduce preventable diseases that impact child mortality and overall life expectancy.
   - Increase public awareness and education about the importance of vaccinations, especially in developing countries.

2. **Invest in Education**:
   - Prioritize educational initiatives that focus on increasing school enrollment and completion rates, particularly for girls and marginalized communities.
   - Implement health education programs in schools to promote healthy lifestyle choices and awareness of healthcare services.

3. **Improve Healthcare Access**:
   - Expand access to healthcare facilities, especially in rural and underserved areas, to ensure that all populations receive timely medical care.
   - Increase funding for healthcare infrastructure that supports preventive care, maternal health, and child health services.

4. **Address Socio-Economic Determinants**:
   - Implement policies that target poverty reduction, including job creation and social safety nets, to improve economic stability and health outcomes.
   - Promote gender equality and empower women through education and economic opportunities, as this can have a significant effect on family health and life expectancy.

5. **Utilize Data-Driven Policies**:
   - Governments and health organizations should use data analytics to identify trends and target interventions effectively. Regular monitoring of health indicators can help in adjusting policies as needed.
   - Collaborate with international organizations to share best practices and resources in health and education.

6. **Community Engagement**:
   - Foster community involvement in health programs to ensure that interventions are culturally appropriate and effectively meet local needs.
   - Encourage partnerships between government, NGOs, and community organizations to leverage resources and expertise.

By implementing these recommendations, countries can work towards significantly improving life expectancy and overall health outcomes for their populations.
